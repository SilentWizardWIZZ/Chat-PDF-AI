[server]
headless = true
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 5000
```

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for AI chat functionality

## Technical Details

### PDF Processing
- Uses PyPDF2 library for text extraction
- Handles encrypted PDFs with appropriate error messages
- Supports multi-page documents
- Cleans and normalizes extracted text

### AI Integration
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model (latest as of May 2024)
- Implements conversation context management
- Limits document content to avoid token limits
- Includes comprehensive error handling for API issues

### Session Management
- Stores chat history in Streamlit session state
- Maintains PDF content until new document upload
- Provides document clearing functionality

## Error Handling

The application handles various error scenarios:

- **Encrypted PDFs**: Clear error messages for password-protected files
- **Corrupted files**: Validation and error reporting for invalid PDFs
- **API issues**: Rate limiting, quota, and authentication error handling
- **Network problems**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages

## Limitations

- PDF content is truncated to 8000 characters to fit within API token limits
- Session data is not persistent across browser sessions
- Requires active internet connection for AI functionality
- Only processes text-based PDFs (image-based PDFs may not work properly)
